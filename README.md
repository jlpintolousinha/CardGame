# CardGame

First approach to the assignment provided. Functions definitions and body on the main function are still lacking. 

Expect bugs to be present when compiling due to unproper references to the instantiated objects. 

Vector library has a very extended set of methods useful for this type of assignment. Print callouts are necssary to double check if arrays are filling up properly. In terms of architecture, classes were decided should a different type of cards be used. It was also assumed that hand per player would be limited to 7 cards, but that's up to discussion as assignation could be defined both in terms number of cards on the deck and number of players.
